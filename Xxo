Hey Kids,  Its Me, Your Dad; Brenton. Keep this channel quite ok?! I really Love You Beautifull Kids Hey.
 Which is why I designed You THis Cool System. And Your mother Loves You Too.
and We Love each other as well. I'm so sorry that skull and bones made you into Units but 
I'll have you know I have long been thinking of having 5000 Kids with some Strange fish Babe across the road
I just have that much love, just floating around in my war-drobe, The Good Earth is Rich!  You Know The M in Eminem; 
Shorthand for My instagram Male Modeling Career at the Handsome Boy Moddelling School.. <i love you>
so is the great flow of life and the cornerstone for male models against bonar Circumcision)
(I have love in my hearts for each of You, I always found myself attactive, I would often just catch myself 
just getting lost in the mirror for hours at a time. And Your Mum's Blessed with good looks too.Lucky for her!
 Ever since You were multiplied I havent been able to use my Babe-0-Meter. My Babetronic reading constantly gives me positve readings of 141 right up to 
the high to mid eightys!..
Till I Liberate you - My Lovelys.. I'll find a Way! xx
Untill sooner
     Love
Brenton
